<i>Immersive virtual reality experiences for all-sky astronomical data</i>

Made with s2plot and A-Frame WebVR, <tt>allskyVR</tt> allows astronomers to immerse themselves in all-sky data.   

The software requires a compatible smart phone and Google cardboard viewer or high-end consumer VR head-mounted display.

- <b>Navigation:</b> turn your head to see the celestial sphere around you.
- <b>Menu:</b> look for the Menu icon, line up the green circular target, hold your gaze steady and the menu will expand.
- <b>Selection:</b> to toggle visibility of a data category or the celestial coordinate system, line-up the reticule on the menu item and hold your gaze steady.
