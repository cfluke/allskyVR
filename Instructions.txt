Which mode should I use?

- If you have, or can create, a text file containing RA, Dec values for your all-sky catalogue, then you may wish to start with the Quickstart mode.
- If you have access to, or a willing to install, the <tt>s2plot</tt> interactive graphics library, and want to be able to modify source code to add new features, than you may wish to try the Fully Customisable mode.
